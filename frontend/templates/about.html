  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      <strong>MedGuard</strong> is a comprehensive web application designed with
      a singular, critical mission: to detect, report, and manage counterfeit
      drugs, thereby safeguarding public health across Nigeria. It serves as a
      vital bridge between the public and regulatory bodies like NAFDAC,
      empowering every citizen to become a guardian of our nation's medicine
      supply.

    <h3 style="color: #8bff9a">The Problems We Solve</h3>
    <p>
      The circulation of counterfeit drugs is a silent epidemic with devastating
      consequences. MedGuard was built to directly address these critical
      challenges:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Protecting Lives:</strong> Fake medications can contain
        incorrect ingredients, wrong dosages, or even toxic substances, leading
        to treatment failure, severe health complications, and death. MedGuard
        provides a first line of defense.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Building Trust:</strong> The fear of counterfeit drugs erodes
        public trust in our healthcare system. By providing a reliable
        verification tool, we help restore confidence in pharmacies and medical
        providers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bridging the Information Gap:</strong> Many citizens lack an
        easy, immediate way to verify their medications. MedGuard closes this
        gap with accessible technology, including offline SMS functionality for
        those without internet access.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Empowering Regulators:</strong> By crowdsourcing real-time data
        on suspicious products, MedGuard provides authorities like NAFDAC with
        the actionable intelligence needed to conduct targeted investigations
        and protect the public more effectively.
      </li>
    </ul>
